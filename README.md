## **Project Title** : Using the Support Vector Mechanism algorithm of supervised machine learning , predict iris.csv dataset to find out whether the species is different or same

## **Problem Statement** : 
## An American based botanical garden grow iris flower in their labs but using biotechnology in a single tree where different types of variety flowers in grown , as a data science engineer how much accuracy is there in all categories which contain same species.

## **Task 1** : Pre process the data in **skit.learn** library.
## **Task 2** : Load the data using **sklearn** model selection default argument.
## **Task 3** : On the basis of the data train test and split the svm model. 
## **Task 4** : Implement support vector mechanism_classifier. The svm must be **"Linear"**.
## **Task 5** : Train the classifier on the training data 
## **Task 6** : Find out the prediction value on the test data.
## **Task 7** : Test the model with the help of accuracy , accuracy should lie in the range of 0 to 1

## **Conclusion** : According to my support vector mechanism model the speices are linear with the accuracy of 1.00.
## Hence the model is successfully implemented.
